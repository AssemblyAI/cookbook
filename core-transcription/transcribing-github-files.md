## **Transcrbing Files Hosted on GitHub with AssemblyAI**

### **Step 1: Upload Your Audio Files to a Public GitHub Repository

- **File Requirements**: GitHub has a file size limit of 100MB so ensure your audio files are 100MB in size or less. The files must be in a public repository otherwise you will recieve an error saying the file is not publicly accessible. For a more secure way to host files check out our [Transcribing from an S3 Bucket Cookbook](transcribe_from_s3.ipynb)

### **Step 2:Obtain the Raw Audio URL from GitHub**

1. Navigate to the repository that houses the audio file. 
2. Click on the audio file and on the next page, right click the "View Raw" link.
