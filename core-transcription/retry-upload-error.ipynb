    "# How to Implement Retry Upload Error Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we'll show you how to set up automatic upload error retry logic in your transcription process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upload errors could be a result of a transient issue with our servers or they could be related to an issue with the file itself. Most likely the issue would be that the file is empty. Because the cause can be unclear at first, we recommend adding some retry logic to handle the rare occasions in which our upload service is experiencing performance issues. If the upload failure persists, you'll want to check whether the file is empty. If you're unclear on why the file is failing, please reach out to our support team at support@assemblyai.com.\n",
