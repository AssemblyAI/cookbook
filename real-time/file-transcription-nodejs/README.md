## AssemblyAI Realtime Example

##### This example will transcribe any local .wav audio file in realtime and then save the final result to a text file. While streaming the file, the console will display the partial text fragments that are sent back in realtime from the Realtime API websocket connection.
##### To read more about this API see [here](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/walkthroughs#realtime-streaming-transcription)


#### To begin run the following commands:

- npm install
- npm start

##### Built with Node v18.8.0
